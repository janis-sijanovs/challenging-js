# Frontend Homework 5

I have completed my fifth homework. 

This one was very long, so I don't remember all the details and potential mistakes.
There's definitely space for improvements, but this is for a first-time frontend course 
and not for a nuclear reactor, so I'll improve my skills over time.

Although it took a long time to complete, this was the most fun homework.
